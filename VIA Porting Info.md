# Making a board compatible with VIA Configurator

**ðŸ’¥NOTEðŸ’¥: Don't do this yet, all of this stuff is still ðŸš‘ðŸ’£BLEEDING EDGEðŸ’£ðŸš‘, and you will ðŸ”ªcut yourselfðŸ”ª badly if you choose to do it. Please wait for ðŸ—¿Wilba's QMK code to be refactored prior to pushing anything to QMK, as we don't want to end up with a bunch of different forks of the code.**

So you've seen VIA Configurator in action, and you want to get this magic supported for your board?

There's two main steps:
1. Add dynamic keymap support to keyboard in QMK
2. Add layout to VIA

### Example
Here's an example port of the Iris that was done based on the WT60-A code:
- [QMK Changes](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/4849/commits/7795bd585c33da2120550d7e6815fb3caa05f2aa)
- [VIA Changes](https://github.com/olivia/via-config/pull/35)

## Adding support in QMK

Wilba suggests looking at the [WT60-A](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/wilba_tech/wt60_a) as an example on getting a PCB compatible with VIA Configurator.

### Changes to `config.h`

1. Make sure `VENDOR_ID`/`PRODUCT_ID` combo is unique, as VIA uses this to detect what board is used. You'll need this later on.
2. Add the lines for EEPROM and DYNAMIC_KEYMAP stuff at the bottom. Make sure you change the values for `DYNAMIC_KEYMAP_MACRO_EEPROM_ADDR` and `DYNAMIC_KEYMAP_MACRO_EEPROM_SIZE` as specified below.

```c
#define DYNAMIC_KEYMAP_LAYER_COUNT 4

// EEPROM usage

// TODO: refactor with new user EEPROM code (coming soon)
#define EEPROM_MAGIC 0x451F
#define EEPROM_MAGIC_ADDR 32
// Bump this every time we change what we store
// This will automatically reset the EEPROM with defaults
// and avoid loading invalid data from the EEPROM
#define EEPROM_VERSION 0x08
#define EEPROM_VERSION_ADDR 34

// Dynamic keymap starts after EEPROM version
#define DYNAMIC_KEYMAP_EEPROM_ADDR 35
// Dynamic macro starts after dynamic keymaps (35+(4*10*6*2)) = (35+480)
#define DYNAMIC_KEYMAP_MACRO_EEPROM_ADDR 515    // **** CHANGE THIS BASED ON MATRIX_ROWS & MATRIX_COLS ****
#define DYNAMIC_KEYMAP_MACRO_EEPROM_SIZE 509    // **** CHANGE THIS BASED ON 1024-DYNAMIC_KEYMAP_MACRO_EEPROM_ADDR ****
#define DYNAMIC_KEYMAP_MACRO_COUNT 16

```

#### Calculating `DYNAMIC_KEYMAP_MACRO_EEPROM_ADDR`:
`DYNAMIC_KEYMAP_MACRO_EEPROM_ADDR = DYNAMIC_KEYMAP_EEPROM_ADDR + (DYNAMIC_KEYMAP_LAYER_COUNT * MATRIX_ROWS * MATRIX_COLS * 2)`

#### Calculating `DYNAMIC_KEYMAP_MACRO_EEPROM_SIZE`:
`DYNAMIC_KEYMAP_MACRO_EEPROM_SIZE = 1024 - DYNAMIC_KEYMAP_MACRO_EEPROM_ADDR`

### Changes to `<keyboard>.c`

Remove code for `matrix_init_kb(void)`.

### Changes to `rules.mk`

Add:

```c
SRC += keyboards/wilba_tech/wt_main.c

RAW_ENABLE = yes
DYNAMIC_KEYMAP_ENABLE = yes
```

Remove any unnecessary features to clear up room for the dynamic keymap code being compiled into the .hex file.

## Adding support in VIA Configurator

Clone the [VIA Configurator repo](https://github.com/olivia/via-config) and create a new branch.

### Changes to `app/utils/device-meta.js`
1. Add new layout macro name in the `import {...} from './kle-parser';` section
2. Add device info to `DEVICE_META_MAP: DeviceMetaMap`

### Changes to `app/utils/hid-keyboards.js`
1. Add VENDOR_ID/PRODUCT_ID combo to `isValidVendorProduct` function

### Changes to `app/utils/layout-parser.js`

1. Copy LAYOUT macro from keyboard in QMK and paste into file as a new exported const
2. Add layout to `MatrixLayout`

### Changes to `app/utils/kle-parser.js`

1. Create layout in [KLE](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com)
    - For boards with columnar stagger (ergolumnar), right now, keep everything in the same row aligned together
2. Copy "Raw data" output
3. Add `export const LAYOUT_<keyboard name>` and paste KLE raw data output into it
4. If spacing between two keys in a row or the spacing from the edge to the first key in a row shows up weird, open up `Key.css` and copy/create a new indent class for the missing spacing, as seen here: https://github.com/olivia/via-config/pull/35/commits/d79e788d45b19d373cb977a7d0e3e9d700978987
